# Portfolio

Hello, here I compile some projects that I made while I expand my Data Science knowledge.
Most of them are in R script format and organized by technique.

I recommend especially the Titanic-ML and MovieLens-Project, those not only have their scripts available but also a final report in PDF.

Thank you in advance for your attention.
