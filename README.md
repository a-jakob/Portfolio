Some personal projects

Hello, here I compile some projects that I made while I expand my Data Science knowledge.
Most of them are in script R format, and organized by technique.
I recommend you to take a look on Titanic-ML and MovieLens-Project, that not only have their scripts available but also a final report in PDF.

Thank you in advance for the attention.
