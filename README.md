Some personal projects

Hello, here I compile some projects that I made while I expand my Data Science knowledge.
Most of them are in R script format and organized by technique.

I would appreciate if you took a look especially at Titanic-ML and MovieLens-Project, that not only have their scripts available but also a final report in PDF.

Thank you in advance for the attention.
